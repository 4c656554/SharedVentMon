# Background

In an emergency, it may be possible to support 2-4 patients from a single ventilator (Fig. 1.) [1-2]. However, this reduces the per-patient information feedback to the practitioners [3-4]. The proposed arrangement (Fig. 2.) seeks to allow per-patient information to be gained in a rapidly deployable way.

This project is seeking to provide information to practitioners in the case of emergency shared ventilator use, through the used of image tracking of existing medical meter devices. See Figure 2.
